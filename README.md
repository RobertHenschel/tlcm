# ThinLinc Connection Manager (tlcm)
This small application helps manage ThinLinc connections for users that need to connect to multiple ThinLinc servers. This is not a replacement for the ThinLinc client, you will still need to have the ThinLinc client installed to use this application. Currently, this application only supports Linux and MacOS.
